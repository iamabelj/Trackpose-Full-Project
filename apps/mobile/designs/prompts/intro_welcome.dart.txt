---------------------------------------------------------
Generate a Flutter screen in Dart that replicates the attached welcome/landing image (intro_welcome.png).
Requirements:
- File: lib/screens/intro_welcome_screen.dart
- Use Material widgets with a modern, soft gradient background and a centered logo above headline text.
- Headline text: "Welcome to TrackPose" (use large, bold, 34sp) and a subtitle exactly: "TrackPose helps families, caregivers, and managers monitor wellbeing with AI insights and care transparency."
- Add a prominent rounded gradient button at the bottom: "Get Started". Also include a small "Log In" link below the button.
- Use Riverpod for any button handlers (but you may stub providers). Use go_router route '/signup' for Get Started and '/login' for Log In.
- Create accessible widgets, responsive layout for phones (safe-area aware).
- Extract any repeated styles to a local Theme or constants in the file with TODO to move to a shared styles file.
- Output a single Dart file and nothing else.
