TrackPose Design Package - Copilot prompts & images
=================================================

This archive contains your uploaded UI images (renamed) and Copilot-ready prompts so you can easily generate matching Flutter screens.
Extract into your Flutter project (apps/mobile/) and follow the steps in designs/hints/README_HINTS.txt.

Renamed image mapping (source -> renamed):
{
  "1.png": "intro_welcome.png",
  "2.png": "how_it_works_1.png",
  "3.png": "how_it_works_2.png",
  "4.png": "privacy_card.png",
  "5.png": "role_selection.png",
  "6.png": "login_screen.png"
}

Quick steps:
1. Extract this package to apps/mobile/
2. Open images in VS Code and use Copilot Chat -> Ask about this file
3. Paste the associated prompt from designs/prompts/*.dart.txt into the chat
4. Save the generated Dart files into lib/screens/

If you prefer, reply 'Generate Dart now' to have me create the screens directly.
