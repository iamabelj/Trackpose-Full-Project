Design: login_screen.png (Welcome Back / Login form)

Prompt for Copilot Chat:
---------------------------------------------------------
Generate lib/screens/login_screen_ui.dart that replicates login_screen.png exactly.
Requirements:
- Title "Welcome Back" (large), subtitle "Sign in to continue monitoring".
- Two rounded input fields with subtle gray backgrounds and inner shadows: Email and Password. Password must include a trailing eye icon to toggle visibility.
- Right-aligned "Forgot Password?" link and a large rounded gradient "Log In" button (purple -> pink gradient). Then small "Don't have an account? Sign up" link and a GDPR-compliant badge at the bottom.
- Validate email format and password length (>=8). On successful submit, call a stubbed provider function and navigate to '/parent-dashboard' (use go_router).
- Output a single Dart file only. Use TODO comments where secure storage or backend calls are required.
